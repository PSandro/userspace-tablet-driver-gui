# Kuri's XP-Pen Userland driver Util (GUI)

I need a better name for this!

This is a new GUI implementation for the userland driver I've written here: https://github.com/kurikaesu/xp-pen-userland

The code is really, really messy right now. Seriously messy.

**It currently only supports the Deco Pro Small and no other device.**

The python GUI will no longer be updates as there are severe limitations on assigning keys to it due to the library I used (pynput).
